Thank you to all [the contributors](https://github.com/thoughtbot/carnival/contributors)!

## Pre-requisites

Carnival is built locally, on CI, and deployed using [halcyon][]. Therefore,
there is **no pre-requisite of a Haskell environment**, though you will need the
following tools:

- PostgreSQL
- CoffeeScript
- Heroku Toolbelt (needed for setup and deployment)
- jq (needed for deployment)
- `brew install bash coreutils` (if on OSX)

[halcyon]: https://halcyon.sh/

## Getting started

Carnival can be setup with one command:

```
$ ./bin/setup
```

How long this takes depends on a number of things. All build artifacts are
cached between anyone who builds Carnival (including Travis and Heroku). This
means many builds can complete in under a minute. Unfortunately, the artifacts
are specific to your platform. If you are the first person to build a given
version of Carnival on your platform, it can take closer to 45 minutes.

## Developing

Before doing anything:

```
$ source <(/app/halcyon/halcyon paths)

# If your shell doesn't support the above, you can use this POSIX version
$ /app/halcyon/halcyon paths > halcyon-env && . halcyon-env
```

This sets the needed environment variables to use halcyon-built dependencies. If
you prefer to set these persistently from your shell profile file, that works
too.

Run a development instance:

```
$ yesod devel
```

Run the tests:

```
$ yesod test
```

Do anything else:

```
$ ghci Model.hs
```

## Deployment

Staging is the default deploy target:

```
$ ./bin/deploy
```

The production app can be passed as an argument if desired:

```
$ ./bin/deploy carnival-production
```

## Migrations

While Yesod will handle some migrations (e.g. new fields) automatically for you,
anything potentially destructive requires manual intervention. Yesod also has no
support for certain database features (e.g. custom indexes). These things need
to be done by hand at a `psql` prompt.

The approach used in this project is to write such migrations as vanilla SQL
scripts, then automatically run them as part of deployment.

The process is as follows:

- Write the needed migration under `migrations/`
- Test the migration locally: `psql carnival < migrations/foo.sql` (Note: You'll
  need to either drop/recreate your test database, or run the migration on it as
  well)
- Deploy to staging with `bin/migrate-deploy carnival-staging foo.sql`
- Deploy to production with `bin/migrate-deploy carnival-production foo.sql`
- Multiple migration files can be passed, they will be run in the order given
